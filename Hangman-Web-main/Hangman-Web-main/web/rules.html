          <p>Hangman is a classic word-guessing game where players try to identify a hidden word by suggesting letters or guessing the words. Incorrect guesses gradually "build" a hanged stick figure, and the game ends if the figure is fully drawn before the word is guessed.
            In hard mode,the letter revealed in the beginning of the game is less present, If you use the same letter, it will count as penalty, if you use more than 3 vowels, then you get a penalty where even if the vowel is correct, you lose an attempt. Also, the used letters are not displayed anymore in guessed letters.</p>
